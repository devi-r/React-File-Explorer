# React File Explorer

This project implements a **dynamic and recursive file explorer** component in React. It mimics the behavior of a typical file system viewer, where folders can be expanded or collapsed, and users can add or remove items at any level of the hierarchy.

## Key Features

- **Recursive Rendering**  
  Folders can contain nested folders or files to any depth using recursion.

- **Expand/Collapse Functionality**  
  Each folder includes toggle icons to expand or collapse its contents.

- **Add Items**  
  Users can dynamically add a file or folder inside any existing folder.

- **Remove Items**  
  Users can delete files or folders from any level of the hierarchy.

- **State Management**  
  The file tree is managed using Reactâ€™s `useState`. All updates propagate cleanly through the recursive structure.

- **Minimal Styling**  
  Clean and readable layout using inline styles and icons to enhance user experience.

## UI Interactions

- **Expanding Items**: Clicking on a folder toggles visibility of its children.
- **Adding Items**: Clicking "Add Folder" or "Add File" opens a modal input.
  - Modal contains:
    - An input field to type the name of the new file or folder.
    - An **Add** button to submit.
    - A **Cancel** button to dismiss the modal without changes.
- **Removing Items**: Each file or folder has a delete icon to remove it from the structure.
